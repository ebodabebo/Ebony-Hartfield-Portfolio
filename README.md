# Portfolio-

As a developer, I want to introduce myself to the coding community and tactfully demonstrate my skillset. As a beginning web developer, I aim to emphasize my grasp of the basics, along with my willingness to fail fast. I am enjoying the process and appreciating where I am as a new developer. I am truly excited to see what I am capable of executing!

As a developer, I want users to enjoy engaging with my work. I want users to have a fun, flawless experience. I want my work to be eye-catching, and awe inspiring. I'm going to get there, it's a work in progress!
